# 🔍 Objective:
# To analyze and visualize audio segments related to different types of sleep apnea by:

Removing noise,

Extracting key features,

Displaying audio signals, spectrograms, and zero-crossing rates.

## 📁 Folder & File Structure:
Loads .wav audio files from Google Drive (/content/drive/MyDrive/Audio_files).

Organizes files into categories and timestamps:

Respiratory_Hypopnea

Respiratory_ObstructiveApnea

Respiratory_MixedApnea

## 🔧 Steps Performed:
Mount Google Drive and install noisereduce.

Import Libraries:

librosa, matplotlib, numpy, noisereduce, etc.

Organize Files:

Parses filenames to categorize recordings and associate timestamps.

Feature Extraction Function (show_features):

Loads and trims audio.

Applies spectral noise reduction using the first 0.5 seconds as noise.

Plays the denoised audio inline.

## Displays:

📈 Waveform

🎛️ Spectrogram

🔢 Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) plot and average

Interactive Menu:

Lets the user choose which category to explore.

Iterates through all audio segments in that category.

Allows step-by-step navigation through segments.

## 📊 Displayed Features:
Waveform: Visualizes amplitude over time.

Spectrogram: Shows frequency intensity over time.

ZCR: Measures how often the signal crosses zero — useful for distinguishing between voiced/unvoiced sounds.

## ✅ Usefulness:
Helps manually inspect patterns across apnea types.

Prepares data for downstream tasks like classification or clustering.

Makes it easy to understand how audio features vary between apnea types.
